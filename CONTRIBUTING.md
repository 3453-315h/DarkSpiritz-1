# What are we looking for?

DarkSpiritz is looking for collaborators to help out with adding and maintaining DarkSpiritz. If you would like to help out you can simply just make a PR for the main GitHub repository with whatever addons or plugins you decide to add in. We are also looking for more than just people to help out with plugins. If you find a bug or an issue in DarkSpiritz feel free to make a PR and get credit for it. All collaborators will be featured and credited in DarkSpiritz.

# Code of Conduct

If you decide to make a DarkSpiritz addon, fix, or plugin you must follow our Code of Conduct to be accepted. What follows holds true for all developers no matter what the circumstances.

1. All PR's must be clean and easily understandable.
2. All plugins must use plugin support.
3. If you require a new configuration value make the with an updated config-skeleton.xml and an updated config.xml (located in /storage.)
4. Plugins and Exploits must be working and have a description included.
5. All addons, plugins, payloads, and exploits must be written in Python 2.
6. If you use another Open Source script you must credit it somewhere in the plugin. (Can be done as a comment)
7. All plugins must be in a folder that is already included and end with the file extension ".plugin".

# Who can contribute?

Anybody can contribute! If you are new, experienced, or anything in between feel free to contribute. We need all the help and support we can get so don't let anything stop you!

# How to submit?

If you would like to submit any changes or things you've added to DarkSpiritz please submit a PR with a clear description of changes and locations of files added along with descriptions for each use of a file. If we find something fishy or something that doesn't belong we will deny the PR and tell you why. Keep all PR's appropriate and professional.
